  for many years. They sometimes sell Scott's prints at the local movie theaters. Suzy has just been diagnosed

"2,790",For the Love of Ben Durst,U.S. Dollar,,of $36.9k goal,35,"For those of you who do not know Ben Durst personally, I am sorry.
  For those of you that do know Ben, I am still sorry. But you know
  why..... (lol) Ben hit a cold reality when he was recently diagnosed with bladder
  cancer. It was a shock to say the least. He is too young and not ready
  to stop making people laugh. He wants to fight.  But he has a problem..... Ben is on Medicare. He does not have prescription drug coverage. The
  one medication he has to take at home to build his white blood cells
  after the chemo kills them off is $4,752 a prescription. He has 7
  refills. That's $33,264 for this prescription for his 4 cycles of
  chemo, and the month after. If he does not get this medication, the
  chemo will surely kill him. This medication will help him fight off
  infection since his white blood cells will no longer have those
  capabilities. There are organizations that will help, and he is in
  communication with them.  However, they are slow to reply and he needs
  to be sure he has financing. He was able to get the first prescription free. Ben has always had 2 goals in life... The first goal is to laugh and
  make others laugh. He went to the hospital telling people he was
  worried about a certain test because he didn't get to study for it. Of
  course, everyone laughed. He loves having parties and getting family
  together. He is always there for his Mom Evelyn, and his sister Lisa.
  He takes care of me, the house and my parents. Ben is a big guy with
  an even bigger heart. His other goal is to work. He is a truck driver and loves being on
  the road. He makes overnight deliveries while seeing the country. An
  active member Fraternal Organization of Eagles #3138 (Taylor, MI), he
  has often stopped in clubs around his delivery locations just to
  support the organization. All he wants to do now is get back to work
  and feel whole again. I am Suzette Pariseau and I have been Ben's better half for more
  than 6 years.  I am an ESL teacher and can take time off work to help
  him, but I do not get paid for the time I take off. Financially, I
  have to take care of our regular bills to keep us afloat.  Ben is also
  a proud man and would never ask for monetary help, so I am doing it
  for him. If you can donate and help him pay for his medications, it
  would be greatly appreciated.  Any amount would help. If you need any
  more information than what I have already posted, or would prefer to
  send a donation via snail-mail, please email me at parisuze@yahoo.com , or Cancer2017SUCKS@yahoo.com . Thank you for your generosity. Everyone loves a comedian. Please help keep Ben Durst laughing....",https://fundrazr.com/helpBenDurst
"8,530",SMA fundraising challenge. 15 PLN - £3 for Adaś.,Polish Zlotych,,of zł500k goal,89,"My name is Ania. I am proud to introduce you a brave, little boy Adaś
  who was born with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 1. Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) ( http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Spinal-muscular-atrophy/pages/introduction.aspx )
   is a genetic disease that causes muscle weakness and progressive loss
  of movement. Type 1 is the most severe and in most cases causes severe
  respiratory problems which means that children rarely survive beyond
  two years of age. 1 in 5000 children is born with SMA around the world. Please join this SMA fundraising challenge and help Adaś to continue
  his experimental therapy treatment. Adaś Skrzypek  was born just
  before Christmas with the worst type of SMA, type 1. His parents were
  told that he would not reach his first birthday. The doctors informed
  them that there is no cure for SMA at the moment and all they could do
  was to wait for the worst, while his muscles slowly withered away
  until his respiratory system failed and cause Adaś to suffocate. But,
  despite terrifying diagnosis, Aneta and Tomasz Skrzypek, Adaś’s
  parents didn’t give up. They started a daily rehabilitation regime for
  Adaś and started searching around the world for a cure. Adaś's
  condition deteriorated quickly which meant he was no longer offered
  experimental therapies in Europe. He was now not able to swallow or
  breathe properly and was fitted with a tracheotomy tube. Adaś nearly
  died several times but he is a little fighter and was able to start an
  experimental therapy which his parents had found. They didn’t give up
  after being refused help in Europe and they searched around the world
  finally coming across a new treatment in America. The therapy involves
  an injection every 45 days and oral medications in between. Adaś was
  given the first injection just before he turned 6 months old. And a
  tiny mirracle had happened!! Adaś was able to breathe for 20 minutes
  all by himself for the first time in a very long time. He was also
  able to slightly move his head and suck a dummy. There is a realistic
  chance that the experimental therapy that Adaś is receiving will be
  successfull. But unfortunately the cost of the treatment have exceeded
  his parents financial capabilities. The cost of it is 80000 polish
  zlotych (£15,000) every 45 days, and this sum will increase once the
  doses get stronger. By helping Adaś, we are helping children around the world who have
  been or may be born with incurable SMA. We can make a difference and
  change the world. We are giving hope to all the parents who were told
  that the only thing they could do was to give up and wait for the
  worst. Please help by donating any amount in polish zlotych (PLN) or
  the equivalent in another currency and sharing it on Facebook. We can
  spread the word and be a part of something amazing!! We can save
  children all around the world. * You are most welcome to donate as much as you wish. FundRarz and

  wczesnodziecięcy jest najpoważniejszy. Objawy choroby pojawiają sie
  zaraz po urodzeniu lub do szóstego miesiąca życia. Dziecko rzadko ma
  szansę przeżycia dwóch lat. 1 na 5000 dzieci na świecie rodzi sie z SMA. Adaś Skrzypek jest malutkim chłopczykiem, który urodził się 20
  grudnia 2015 roku w Tarnowie. Adaś jest chory na SMA typ 1. Jego
  rodzice, Aneta i Tomasz Skrzypek, przed Wigilią dowiedzieli się, że
  ich długo wyczekiwany synek może nie doczekać swoich pierwszych
  urodzin. Lekarze nie dawali Adasiowi żadnych szans. Jedyne co Państwo
  Skrzypek mogli zrobić, to poddać się i czekać, aż mięśnie Adasia
  zwiotczeją, a uklad oddechowy przestanie działać i Adaś sie udusi.
  Jednak rodzice Adasia z pełną determinacją podjęli poszukiwania
  eksperymentalnej terapii w Europie, która dałaby szansę Adasiowi.
  Niestety po początkowym zakwalifikowaniu Adasia do jednej z terapii,
  stan chłopca pogorszył sie na tyle, że odmówiono jego leczenia. Adaś
  był kilka razy bliski śmierci, ale jest malutkim wojownikiem i przeżył
  po to, by móc wziąść udział w eksperymentalnej terapii, którą znaleźli
  jego rodzice. Nie poddali sie kiedy odmówiono Adasiowi leczenia w
  Europie i rozpoczęli poszukiwania na szeroką skalę na całym świecie,
  aby wreszcie znaleźć nadzieję w Ameryce. Chłopczykowi zaproponowano
  terapię w trakcie, której co 45 dni dostaje zastrzyk, a w między
  czasie przyjmuje leki doustne. Adaś pierwszy zastrzyk dostał niedługo
  przed swoim 6 miesiącem życia. I stał sie maleńki cud!! Adaś był w
  stanie samodzielnie oddychać przez 20 minut, czego nie mógł robić już
  od długiego czasu. Mógł również lekko poruszać główką i trzymać
  smoczek w buźce. Nie mógł tego robić od wielu tygodni. Jest realna
  szansa, że ta eksperymentalna terapia, której Adaś jest poddawany,
  będzie zakończona sukcesem. Niestety, koszt terapii przerósł
  możliwości finansowe rodziców Adasia. Jej koszt, to 80 tysięcy złotych
  co 45 dni. Może to ulec zwiększeniu, kiedy dozy staną się mocniejsze.
  Pomagając Adasiowi, pomagamy dzieciom na całym świecie, które już są
  lub urodzą się chore na nieuleczalną chorobę rdzeniowego zaniku mięśni
  (SMA). Możemy zmienić ich świat i dać nadzieję rodzicom, którym
  powiedziano, że jedyną rzeczą, którą mogą zrobić, to poddać się i
  czekać na najgorsze. Proszę, pomóżcie Adasiowi wpłacając datki w
  złotówkach lub ich równowartość w innych walutach i udostępniając to
  na Facebooku. Możemy rozpowszechnić informację o Adasiu i być częścią
  czegoś wspaniałego!! Możemy wspólnie uratować dzieci na całym świecie!! * Jeśli są Państwo w stanie wplacić więcej niż 2 funty, to serdecznie

  her spirit still keep glowing—still keep pushing on—despite the daily
  obstacles she faces. Col does not like to complain so she doesn't want us to list all of

  feels like she's dying. A number of her doctors don't take insurance and need to be paid out
  of pocket (just one office visit can cost $600!) and the treatment
  they prescribe is also not covered by insurance. She has been sick for
  numerous years so you can imagine the toll that that takes. Her illness is not something you'd know about unless you are close to
  her. But it's very serious and it severely impedes her quality of
  life. And her closest friends and family are very concerned— *We want her to be with us for years to come!* Please join me in doing what you can to help Col win this war within
  her body and pave her road to healing. A Message from Sue Elliott ... Have you ever met somebody — even online — and instantly loved that person? I’m not talking about lust. I’m not even talking about appreciation. What I mean is some sort of deep, soul-level recognition. A
  feeling like “home,” like “It’s so good to see you again after all
  these years! I do so adore you!” That’s how I felt about Col the first time I saw her photo and
  read a comment she had posted online in a business-oriented group
  years ago. Since then, I’ve gotten to know Col “better,” and I still have
  that same feeling. She’s like a cross between an angel, a friend and a sister! We have amazing conversations in which we both let go of all
  kinds of “stuff” that no longer serves us and we experience huge AHA moments! If you had asked me a year or so ago how I felt about Col, I
  would have told you that she’s a dear, dear friend, at the very least. And yet, as close as we had gotten on so many levels, I
  had NO idea that Col was often in severe physical pain. Not only does she not complain about pain, she’s so genuinely
  joyful and inspired and inspiring, it never dawned on me that she
  could be anything but energetic and “healthy.” Her very being exudes well-being! Col wrote a beautiful blog post that illustrates her approach to
  life and living, even in the midst of pain... even in the midst of
  illness. Please take a couple minutes to be inspired by the beauty of
  Col’s approach to — and dance with — life: Dancing in the Rain . Throughout the pain and the illness, Col has been giving to
  others in the most magnificent way. She created a FREE program called Magical Medical Mystery Tour , in which she
  interviewed amazing healers of all kinds. She created a forum in which
  these experts shared their wisdom freely with anyone who cared to
  participate. The gift of these interviews continues to unfold within
  me and, I’m sure, within all who were game for the adventure. So when Col told me that she now has one or two Western medical
  doctors for EACH of her organs! —and as much as she loves and
  appreciates them, Western medicine doesn’t seem to be working for her
  particular illness — I didn’t have to ask if she had tried natural and
  alternative healing modalities. I knew she had — with joy and
  enthusiasm and insight ... And yet, her body still has more to say — more insights to
  reveal — and it wants to reveal those insights and that wisdom through
  biological medicine. Col has received many “nudges” from the universe
  pointing her in that direction — and this is a woman who KNOWS how to
  listen to and dance with the universe. Like all great dances, it’s a two-way experience. There is
  giving and receiving. And there is constant expansion. One of the most obvious — and magnificent — benefits of this
  expansive dance with the universe and with pain and illness has been
  creativity. Everything that Col learns and experiences goes deep
  within her being and comes out as ART! Art with spirit. Art with soul. Art with purpose. And art that
  is infused with the energy of healing and a return to balance and wholeness! If you feel inspired, I encourage you to listen to your soul.
  Listen to your body. Listen to your inner response to Col’s artwork.
  And if something resonates deeply within you, please purchase it. Not only will you be bringing something beautiful and powerful
  into your own home or office, you will be helping to make Col’s dream
  come true, the universe-directed dream to receive biological treatment. I know I will be buying several pieces of Col’s work for myself
  and to give as gifts. And I know I will not be alone. Col is so loved
  by so many! Sue Elliott Founder/Editor-in-Chief of Law of Attraction Magazine www.LovingMyself.com ..................................................

  it , and the people who is surround. Due to this pathology,
  the routine, habits and custom of the child and the family, are
  strongly altered. Chemonkey is a project for kids who are living chemotherapy process,
  during the investigation, we realized that there wasn't any
    guide that the parents could use to explain their kids what
  they were living or were about to live. This is a hard task to do,
  because they don't know how to do it and the proper words to use. The
  main aim of this project is to ensure the kid's emotional well-being,
  to improve his experience and also to prepare him, so that he can
  face, in a better way, all the process. Chemonkey works as a tool for explaining, by an optimistic way and
  with proper words, the treatment and the side effects of it. So kids
  could understand their illness. The main character of the book is a
  monkey, who already lived the treatment, it shares his experience and
  will be their new best friend, who will share all this time with them.
  It increases kid's well being and help them to say their feelings,
  what really matters during this time. (We tested the prototypes with three kids, in all of them
    increased their self esteem , some of them believed that if her monkey could do it, she could
    too. They became brave and stop cover their eyes because of the
    needles. Also, it helps to the parents, because kids reflected
    themselves in the monkey, so if the monkey wants to sleep, they are
    trying to say that they're tired, so that is really helpful for the
    parents to know the emotions of their child) Please consider giving a donation to this project, any amount will

    14. He had a great work ethic and worked not only his full time job
    but side jobs. He was a mechanic and painter a nd
    his main career was for 30+years as a Manager and District Manager
    in the Grocery field. In September 2015 his life was changed forever. As he was
    closing at his new job for the night, two armed men came in and
    robbed the store. He was beaten for over 20 minutes against the safe
    and with the handgun. Michael has had both knees operated on due to
    being slammed to the floor numerous times. He now has black out
    seizures, some are in the brain and many of the seizures are Grand
    Mal. In April of this year I came home to find him in a continual
    seizure episode. He was hospitilized and in ICU. His hospital stay
    ran for a week and I lost income due to having to stay with him. His
    diagnosis is TBI, PTSD and 80% loss of hearing on his left side (we
    are awaiting surgery on that issue); he will never be able to work
    according to his Doctors and he is unable to drive so, we have to
    pay for his rides to therapy, Doctors visits etc. Our medical bills are mounting and there has been no place to
    go for needed items. We have applied for his SSD but they are in the
    hearing stage which can be another 18 months. We have monthly
    expenses for monitors to keep him safe, and the loss of his income
    has left us with no savings and behind on bills. We have filed for
    everything under the sun but we are still waiting, with no end in
    sight. Our needs are to pay his medical bills, maintain payment on
    his fall detection monitor, get him a new cane and pay for the
    numerous supplements that he has to take. If all bills get paid with
    this campaign, I'd also be exlploring hyperbaric treatment; studies

"14,180",Please Help Bob Continue Fighting Parkinson's!,U.S. Dollar,,of $50k goal,66,"Bob Sobo has been a servant of God and of people throughout his whole
  adult life.  He’s been an Associate Pastor, Senior Pastor and Shelter
  Manager for the San Fernando Valley Rescue Mission where he helped
  many homeless families get back on their feet.  Bob has also had a
  passion for music since boyhood, and he achieved professional status
  as a guitar player and songwriter. Bob has also been a devoted husband and father. He has dedicated his
  life to the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom; and yet that pursuit has
  never made him cold or impersonal.  Anyone who has heard Bob laugh
  knows this to be true!  His wry humor and rapier wit have the capacity
  to put any person at ease, as anyone who has spent time with him can
  attest to. Sadly, in December of 2006 when Bob was just 52, he was diagnosed
  with Parkinson’s Disease. Doctors believe that the onset was
  exacerbated by a head injury Bob incurred in a tragic traffic
  collision with a negligent driver in October of that year. This terrible accident occurred as he was heading to a musical gig. 
  Then, like now, he was accompanied by the incomparable Sandy Howell,
  who thankfully incurred only minor injuries.  As a result of that
  accident, the Parkinson’s which would most probably have laid dormant
  for the majority of Bob’s life, surfaced with a vengeance. This disease has exacted a terrible toll on Bob. The first thing that Parkinson’s took from Bob was his ability to
  make music with his guitar.   The loss of that light within the world
  has been immeasurable; anyone who has spent any time with Bob knows
  that a guitar in his hands is like a painter with fresh watercolors,
  staring at a beautiful vista… His ability to make that instrument sing
  shaped the majority of my childhood, and it was a shock to everyone
  around him when he couldn’t play anymore. But Bob persevered. The next thing that Parkinson’s took from Bob was his ability to
  drive and speak publicly. Everyone was taken by surprise at how Bob’s
  Parkinson’s advanced so quickly, and in such a degenerative manner. 
  Nonetheless, with the help of a few friends, family, and Ms. Sandy
  Howell, Bob was able to continue. Bob persevered. Despite all efforts to the contrary, things have gotten worse for
  Bob.  As a result, he now requires round-the-clock, live-in caregivers
  who assist him in all regular daily functions.  The financial
  assistance that is available to him through normal channels just is
  not at all sufficient to cover his medical and care costs.  He is
  desperate need of additional funding, and he has no means to procure
  it for himself.   He has had some additional help from a kind
  benefactor, but this major portion of his funding is going to come to
  an end, soon. So—the question becomes:  does anyone out there want to help out
  Bob?  He needs your help in order to persevere further.  He is working
  with therapists and doctors, and doing his best throughout all of
  these trials and tribulations.  Will you stand with him?  Can you? He doesn’t want to be in the position where he needs to ask for
  help.  Unfortunately, it’s gotten to the point of him actually needing
  to do so in order to survive.  I know it’s a lot to ask for in this
  day and age; we all have our issues and problems.  Trouble doesn’t
  discriminate, as I’m sure we all know. But Bob needs some help.  Please do what you can.  Let’s help Bob
  persevere further.   On his behalf, I thank each and every one of you
  for your time.  C’mon, let’s do this!",https://fundrazr.com/adLI0

  improverished children. We cover our own travel and all associated
  expenses. We are asking you to help us raise funds for this school so
  that the children can obtain medical care at local clinics and
  hospitals. We continue to work with a local clinc and strengthen those
  ties. All funds go directly towards the cost of medical care. In 2016 fundraiser we raised $7,745.00, $1,235 more than the
  goal! The projected expenses for  medical care (including
  hospitalization, consults, labs, x-rays, scans, medicines,
  transportation, etc) for 2017 equates to $789.31 per month or $9471.73
  for the whole year. After we deducted the $1,235 ""excess"" we
  raised last year, the total goal for 2017 is $8,400. This puts us just past the financial goal. The reason for the increase in the budget this year is: The Quetzal has strengthened substantially compared to the
      USD, previously it was 7.75/1, now it is down to 7.3/1. Over the last year we have increased our numbers to 679
      students across the Foundation. On November 18, 2017 we are hosting a fundraiser at the Yakima Sports
  Center. We will be sharing our stories while hosting a silent auction,
  having a split the pot or 50/50 (winner took home almost $200 last
  year!) and games. Please help us with this fundraiser that will enable
  hundreds of impoverished children obtain access to healthcare. We support children and their future. People (specifically children)
  are the best investment. In order to improve a population you need
  empowerment and independence. The proven form has been education.
  These children face countless socioeconomic and psychological
  barriers. A holistic approach is required to improve longterm
  outcomes. What these children face on a near daily basis makes all of
  our life obstacles seem pity. The staff and volunteers provide long
  term commitment. They genuinely care and love the community in which
  they are empowering. They sacrifice so much for others. This is a long
  term and sustainable commitment. They aren't going anywhere unless
  these socioeconomic issues are resolved. If you are able, please help us and help spread the word. Any
  donation is greatly appreciated. These children are combating extreme
  poverty and many face inhuman conditions. This school provides a safe
  haven where they can break the cycle of poverty. All donations go
  directly to medical cost and does not cover any administration fees.

    have changed. As some of you may know, back at the beginning of the
    year, my mother was informed she has cancer. She has the cells, but
    thankfully they haven't mutated over. Doctors have her on treatment,
    but they have cautioned her against over stressing, as that may
    cause the cells to mutate. Unfortunately, with my mothers other
    health issue, stress is par for the course. Years ago, she was in an
    accident, where she tore all the ligaments in her neck. She has to
    see a specialist every 2-3months, for botox injections to her neck,
    to temporarily restore use of those ligaments. Normally, this is
    covered under her health insurance. However, when she switched to a
    more local specialist, they handle the billing differently. My
    mother was paying out of her pocket, and not being reimbursed the
    full amount. This has since been fixed, but she was not compensated
    those initial payments. To put it into perspective, each vial of
    botox is $700, and she needs about six. (It's 12 injections to the
    neck). I only ask for help, because I can no longer afford to help
    her with the debt, due to my reduction of hours. And I don't want my
    mother over stressing, and risking the cancer becoming active.""",https://fundrazr.com/c1IiS8
385,SHHH! Help James see colors for the best Christmas,U.S. Dollar,"Nov 23, 2017",of $599 goal,7,"WHAT IS ENCHROMA? Over 300 million people worldwide are affected by red-green color
  vision deficiency, also called color blindness. Enchroma has created
  glasses which enhance color vision without the compromise of color
  accuracy. Enchroma glasses are an optical assistive device; they are not
      a cure for color blindness. Results vary depending on the type and
      extent of color vision deficiency per individual. The glasses are
      estimated to be effective for 4 out of 5 cases (80%) of red-green
      color vision deficiency – prospective users are encouraged to take
      our online color vision test to assess the likelihood of efficacy. Enchroma does not
      endorse use of the glasses to pass occupational screening tests
      such as the Ishihara test. For more information please read the FAQs , learn about the Enchroma technology and story , or contact customer support . Check out these reactions",https://fundrazr.com/f1I321

"2,950",Hope For Sebastian,,,,,"Sebastian Major is 16 years old. He is a loving, caring young man who
  enjoys reading, video games, hanging out with his friends, and, like
  most kids, fighting with his brother and sister. In October 2011, Sebastian was diagnosed with Stage IV
  Neuroblastoma, a cancer that starts in the nerve cells, and is rarely
  found in children over the age of 4. He is nearing the end of a long,
  difficult road. His initial treatments were at St. Louis
    Childrens. He has endured 6 rounds of high-dosage chemotherapy, a
    bone marrow transplant, 18 bone marrow biopsies, a major surgery to
    remove a large mass from his abdomen, and countless tests and scans.
    He had 2 rounds of mibg radiation therapy in Cincinnati, OH, and 40
    rounds of palliative radiation at Carle Hospital in Champaign, IL.
    He also received treatment at Comer Children's Hospital in Chicago,
    where he had a team of oncologists who specialize in Neuroblastoma.
    We were unable to improve his disease. In July 2014, following
    complications due to chemo, Sebastian decided to stop treatment.
    He's been on hospice care ever since then.",https://fundrazr.com/BastianHope
"6,450",Please help fund Aimee Kelso's treatment costs,U.S. Dollar,"Dec 19, 2017",of $30k goal,38,"For those of you that don't know me or know me well, three
      years and four months ago my life’s journey took a sharp turn.
      With no real warning the ‘C’ word entered my world like a tidal
      wave. Over the next two months I endured test after test and scan
      after scan to determine just what I was dealing with and how to
      treat it. We prayed, we wept, we yelled, we sat quiet, we
      questioned, we doubted, we fought. Against the grain and advice of
      many, I chose non-traditional treatment. This was a life-changing
      decision. My entire lifestyle was to be changed; eating, resting,
      processing. It was a very difficult time for me, making all the
      changes necessary for my health and then having things change due
      to my choice. Changing my diet and learning my new way of eating
      was super tough; saying no to things giving myself more time for
      rest and healing was super tough; navigating work, loss of work,
      relationships and loss of relationships was super tough; but I did it. I am now faced with a not so new challenge...my cancer is
        back. I have spent the last month enduring labs, tests and scans
        to figure out what we are dealing with now. We have consulted
        with doctors from both sides of the treatment world. It has been
        a long, overwhelming process, but we have made a decision. So I
        will be heading to Germany for treatment. My Rick will be with
        me the first two weeks of what will be approximately six weeks
        of intense treatment. This leaves our precious girls here with
        Grandma and Grandpa for that time and a huge support group of
        friends to bridge the gaps! I covet your prayers as I begin this
        treatment. Protection of my girls, wisdom and patience for my
        husband, strength and peace for my mom, travel mercies,
        successful treatment, eradicating the cancer are just a few of
        the prayer requests I would ask of you. Thank you in advance for
        joining me in prayer. It is our most powerful weapon against the darkness. Psalm 46:1-7 God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble. 2 Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, 3 though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging.[c] 4 There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy place where the Most High dwells. 5 God is within her, she will not fall; God will help her at break of day. 6 Nations are in uproar, kingdoms fall; he lifts his voice, the earth melts. 7 The Lord Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress.

"1,551,850",American Gut,,,,,"The Human Microbiome Project and other microbiome projects worldwide
  have laid an important foundation for understanding the trillions of
  microbes that inhabit our bodies and their impact on health and
  disease. However, opportunities for the public to get involved in such
  research have been limited. Now, American Gut gives you an opportunity
  to join this research project and learn what’s living on and inside you American Gut is a project built on open-source, open-access
  principles. The data we collect is de-identified and then deposited
  into open repositories for the benefit of other researchers and scientists. Join the project! Joining is simple! Select the kit you would like from the list of
  options on the left-hand side by clicking “Claim this perk”. Your kit
  will be sent via mail within 1-2 weeks after payment. International participants are also welcome to join. However, please
  note that a $25 shipping fee does apply. We ask that samples be sent
  back to our lab within 48-72 hours. The cost of expedited shipping to
  our lab in the US from some locations can be expensive, so it is also
  recommended that you look into the cost of return shipping. If you are currently residing in Europe, visit our sister site the British Gut to join this
  research project. A few important points to remember before joining this
    research project: 1. Note your de-identified information will be part of a research
  study and will be made available in a publicly available research
  database. That is, any personal information that might easily identify
  who you are will be removed before being placed in the public database. 2. If you decide that you no longer wish to continue in this study,
  you will be requested to contact the American Gut Project help line
    ( info@americangut.org ) to inform us of your intent
  to withdraw. You may request a refund within 50 days of your original
  payment if you have not yet used your kit. Please note that the
  Fundrazr transaction fee will be deducted from your refund. 3. The consent forms are maintained on the participant website;
  details are included in your kit. To sign the consent form, you must

"447,107",British Gut,,,,,"This is a unique open collaboration between the TwinsUK team at King's College London and The
      American Gut Project (AGP) to try to understand the bacterial
    diversity of the British Gut . *Notice: We are experiencing some delays with kit turnover, so
    please allow 2-3 weeks for your kit to arrive.* Many people don't realize that the bacteria that live inside us play
  an incredibly important role in our health. There are so many of them,
  that they make up 90 percent of the cells in our body and their most
  important jobs include manufacturing vitamins for us and breaking down
  and digesting our food. The trillions of bacteria in our gut weigh
  nearly 2 kg (over 4lbs). This community of bacteria can be thought of
  as an extra 'organ' which we call our ""microbiome"". We
  evolved together with our microbiome over millions of years. Recent
  research has discovered that small changes in this finely balanced
  community can affect our immune system, metabolism, body weight, mood
  and may even cause diseases such as Crohn's disease, irritable bowel
  syndrome, cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes and heart disease. This is the first project of its kind in Europe and, with your help,
  we will be able to discover more about the crucial relationship
  between our health and our microbiome, and on a personal level, you
  will be able to discover the bacterial profile of your own gut. With
  your help, we hope to be able to answer questions such as 'How much
  does our choice of lifestyle and diet influence our microbiome, and
  can we alter our microbiome to make us healthier?' We are discovering that each person is very different and has their
  own unique microbiome. More research is needed to work out what
  constitutes a 'healthy' microbiome, and which combinations of bacteria
  should try and be avoided. In order to do this ambitious and
  much-needed project, we urgently need a large scale collection of
  human samples. Over 7 thousand people have already signed up in
  America already- but we need many more from UK Europe. The project mainly focuses on the gut as this is our main 'microbial
  home', however, the study will also look at oral, skin and (for women)
  vaginal communities as these areas of the body have problems such as
  tooth decay, gum disease, acne and infertility and may be influenced
  by the microbiome. What does it entail? First you need to sign up (see Perks on the right) and select your
  level of contribution to the project. Within two weeks, you will
  receive a kit in the mail together with detailed instructions on how
  to proceed. Shipping within the UK first class should be around £2.90,
  but we recommend taking the sample to the post office to get the
  proper postage. Getting the postage right on the first try is
  important since samples that spend a long time in transit will likely
  not produce the highest quality results. After you have returned your
  sample to us, the samples will be processed and analysed by the Knight
  Lab at University of California, San Diego and you will be provided
  with a list of the major groups of bacteria in your sample and the
  proportions in which they are found. We estimate that this will take
  around 3 months (but possibly longer) and once we provide you with
  your results, you will be able to see how your bacterial community
  compares to others in the study. From the diet and lifestyle
  information that you provide, we will also be able to show you how
  your results compare to other people who are within the same diet and
  lifestyle group as you (but having a very different result to them
  does not necessarily mean anything bad, it can just be that you have
  experienced slight lifestyle differences that mean that your bacterial
  profile is different). Please note that this is a scientific study, not a clinical or
      commercial project, and we will not be able to provide you with
      any clinical information related to your microbiome profile. How will my sample be used? The British Gut project, like the American model, gives participants
  the opportunity to compare their personal microbiome profiles to
  family members, and other people both in the UK and abroad. Our
  project is based on the principles of 'access to all'. The data
  collected from the sample you provide will be shared anonymously both
  with participants and scientists, allowing many different scientific
  hypotheses and questions to be answered using your valuable sample. We look forward to working together on this new and exciting project.
