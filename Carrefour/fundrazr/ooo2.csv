      more giving than anyone I have ever met. I hate that this was
      taken away from him. I hate that he didn't notice it going away.
      He talks about it often. I know what this would mean to him. And I know what it would
      mean to me to make this happen. Thank you so much for stopping by here. If you can, please

  the routine, habits and custom of the child and the family, are
  strongly altered. Chemonkey is a project for kids who are living chemotherapy process,
  during the investigation, we realized that there wasn't any
    guide that the parents could use to explain their kids what
  they were living or were about to live. This is a hard task to do,
  because they don't know how to do it and the proper words to use. The
  main aim of this project is to ensure the kid's emotional well-being,
  to improve his experience and also to prepare him, so that he can
  face, in a better way, all the process. Chemonkey works as a tool for explaining, by an optimistic way and
  with proper words, the treatment and the side effects of it. So kids
  could understand their illness. The main character of the book is a
  monkey, who already lived the treatment, it shares his experience and
  will be their new best friend, who will share all this time with them.
  It increases kid's well being and help them to say their feelings,
  what really matters during this time. (We tested the prototypes with three kids, in all of them
    increased their self esteem , some of them believed that if her monkey could do it, she could
    too. They became brave and stop cover their eyes because of the
    needles. Also, it helps to the parents, because kids reflected
    themselves in the monkey, so if the monkey wants to sleep, they are
    trying to say that they're tired, so that is really helpful for the
    parents to know the emotions of their child) Please consider giving a donation to this project, any amount will
  help. Whether you can give or not, please share this widely with
  friends on facebook, twitter, e-mail, or any other social media. The more people who see this project, more kids will be
