When he was first in school his teacher was concerned because\n    he would only use crayon with their color label still attached.\n    Later on they found out he was reading the color name. When Curtis,\n    John's father, was doing research for his graduate degree, he\n    discovered that John was Red-green color blind. People John meets\n    these days can't tell he is colorblind because John work's daily to\n    strengthen his ability to distinguish colors. To this day he can't\n    tell the difference between cantaloupe and honeydew. John's accomplishments John has taken many art classes. He\n    is a great artist and wants to be a better one. This\n    was done on a Post-It Note This\n    is also on a Post-It Note Reasons to Donate John would benefit greatly from this experience. Anything helps.

This is a hard task to do,\n  because they don't know how to do it and the proper words to use. The\n  main aim of this project is to ensure the kid's emotional well-being,\n  to improve his experience and also to prepare him, so that he can\n  face, in a better way, all the process. Chemonkey works as a tool for explaining, by an optimistic way and\n  with proper words, the treatment and the side effects of it. So kids\n  could understand their illness. The main character of the book is a\n  monkey, who already lived the treatment, it shares his experience and\n  will be their new best friend, who will share all this time with them.\n  It increases kid's well being and help them to say their feelings,\n  what really matters during this time. (We tested the prototypes with three kids, in all of them\n    increased their self esteem , some of them believed that if her monkey could do it, she could\n    too.

Also, it helps to the parents, because kids reflected\n    themselves in the monkey, so if the monkey wants to sleep, they are\n    trying to say that they're tired, so that is really helpful for the\n    parents to know the emotions of their child) Please consider giving a donation to this project, any amount will\n  help.

From working as a seasonal\n    mountain guide in Skagway, Alaska to climbing at the Red River Gorge\n    in Slade, Kentucky, he has been hoarding exciting experiences and\n    showing the world how rewarding wanderlust can be. (If you aren\u2019t\n    already, you can follow him and his friends\u2019 expeditions on Facebook\n    via \"Greasehound Adventures\" or on Instagram via @greasehoundadventures.) What you may not know is that Bryce is actually red-green\n      color blind, meaning his eyes\u2019 retinal cone cells don\u2019t respond to\n      specific light frequencies, barring hi m from being able to tell many colors apart. Using color\n      vision science and optical technology, Enchroma glasses are \u201cthe\n      only specialty eyewear that alleviates red-green color blindness,\n      enhancing colors without the compromise of color accuracy.\u201d Here\u2019s where your support comes in: by donating to this\n      *SECRET* fundraiser for a pair of Enchroma glasses, you can help\n      Bryce experience the world in full color for the very first time!\n      Any contribution, big or small, is greatly appreciated. Unable to\n      donate? No worries\u2014just invite any additional friends and/or\n      family that may want to help. We have one month (fundraiser ends\n      December 14th) to raise $429 so we can surprise him with a pair of\n      these bad boys on Christmas Day. Thank you in advance for your\n      support; this is going to mean the world to Bryce! Feel free to contact me (Hi, I'm Bryce's girlfriend) with\n      any questions, or if you'd like to send a personal message to\n      Bryce along with your donation.

{"campaignTitle": "Enchroma Sunglasses for Scott's Birthday!", "amountRaised": ["300"], "goal": "of $350 goal", "currencyType": ["U.S. Dollar"], "endDate": "", "numberContributors": ["13"], "story": "Scott has always joked with me whenever I wear something green or\n  red that he can't tell what color it is, but when we've been on hikes\n  he actually doesn't see the red wildflowers in the field until I point\n  them out and then he mostly takes my word for it. I'm sure all of his\n  friends have had similar experiences as well but I think he would\n  actually LOVE being able to see more with these glasses which is why... How can you help? I think it would be great to get him a collective gift from his\n  family and close friends, a pair of Enchroma sunglasses. Enchroma has\n  created glasses which enhance color vision without the compromise of\n  color accuracy with people with color blindness. And I've already had\n  Scott take their test to determine what KIND of color blindness he has\n  and how effective the glasses might be. I can think of no better gift to give this guy for his birthday\n  than some swanky sunglasses that'll let him see what kind of apple\n  he's eating and a lot more of the natures beauty too. Any level of contribution helps friends! Best, Kelly Check out these reactions:", "url": ["https://fundrazr.com/scootersrum"], "test": "true"},

Over 300 million people worldwide are affected by red-green color\n  vision deficiency, also called color blindness. Enchroma has created\n  glasses which enhance color vision without the compromise of color\n  accuracy. Enchroma glasses are an optical assistive device; they are not\n      a cure for color blindness. Results vary depending on the type and\n      extent of color vision deficiency per individual. The glasses are\n      estimated to be effective for 4 out of 5 cases (80%) of red-green\n      color vision deficiency \u2013 prospective users are encouraged to take\n      our online color vision test to assess the likelihood of efficacy. Enchroma does not\n      endorse use of the glasses to pass occupational screening tests\n      such as the Ishihara test.
